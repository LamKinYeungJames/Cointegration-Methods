# Cointegration Methods

This project aims to implement and compare methods that are commonly used in constructing cointegrated pairs. The methods that would be compared here are:
1. Basic least square methods
2. Rolling regression
3. Kalman filter

And finally, an interactive visualisation tool for users to input any stock pairs and calculation methods they want to look at have been built.
